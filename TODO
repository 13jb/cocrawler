Short-term TODO list:

make soft fail requeue... add a retry count

PriorityQueue ! (prio, work), low prio goes first
 prio = pathlength to seed ... eventually combined with rank?
 embed -= 1
 add in a random number between 0-1 to shake things up a bit

plugin system revamp

add css parsing and parse embeds to a mocked test

Polite crawling
 affected by: 503s, slow replies, and crawl-delay in robots
 Try a per-host Queue with timeslot tokens? filled by main coroutine?

Save/Restore queues -- perhaps reranking the priorities?
 shorter path-to-seed might have been found, plus rank could update

seed from sitemap

wire in warc code -- pip warc is BSD
  doc for package does not explain how to generate good headers

get an example of each usecase written up -- useragent foo

release version 1.0 ----------------------------------------

re2 for regex parsing speed? difficult to install.

write Apache-licensed surt module

parser-based extraction of links and embeds - see commonsearch gumbocy

Per-host queues; domain, publicprefix, cctld stats

Datalayer-using queue-fillers

helpers to fetch from IA cdx: domain count, detailed reports, guesses at irrelevant cgi args

helpers to fetch from Alexa million, quantcast million
